The Stranger
High Plains Drifter
verse:
number: ‘13’
text: |
What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear? Hope and fear are both phantoms
that arise from thinking of the self.
When we don’t see self as self,
what do we have to fear?
See the world as yourself.
Have faith in the way things are.
Love the world as yourself;
Then you can care for all things.</h2>
<p>In a rare moment of openness, the Stranger shares a bit of wisdom to the pained
and terrified people of Lago. He is trying, perhaps, to help them in a gentler manner than his usual violent style. Help them understand the real reason he as shown up on their doorstep.</p>
<p>In other words, the Stranger is saying, “This is happening to you now because of the anger and selfishness you carry around but won’t admit to. If you would but do the right thing, I’ll ride off and leave you in peace.”
Stephen Mitchell’s interpretation of this verse from the Tao Te Ching is that the outer experience is a reflection or mirror of the inner one. To “see the world as you see yourself” is to love it just the way it is. When your “self-ishness” takes over, you cling to hope and fear, and the outer world becomes as desperate and crazy as the inner.
The Stranger actually makes this comment to only one person, the hotel proprietor’s wife. She tells the Stranger that the town’s people are afraid of him because he is dangerous. But Eastwood makes it clear he is not the one they should be most afraid of.
She alone realizes the inner corruption the Lagoan’s can’t seem to overcome and finally packs up and moves on; leaving them all to their inevitable, deathly fate.</p>

He who stands on tiptoe doesn’t stand firm.
He who rushes ahead

He who tries to shine
dims his own light.
He who defines himself
can’t know who he really is.
He who has power over others can’t empower himself.
He who clings to his work
will create nothing that endures.</h2>
<p>If I had to define Inspector Callahan in one word, I would use the word grounded.
Though he often has to take matters into his own hands, he is not the ghostly loner of the Spaghetti Westerns. He knows his place is out on the street, following leads and</p>
<p>apprehending law-breakers. He has no ambition towards being a politician or part of the bureaucracy and this seems to be just fine with him.
In this film, “Dirty” Harry discovers the righteous indignation of a small faction of cops who see themselves as above the system. They go beyond their limitations as enforcers of the law to become judge, jury and executioner. They are lost to their own twisted ideals.
Callahan, conversely, is focused on what he knows he is able to do and sets about doing it. There is no fanfare or accolades and he doesn’t expect any.
Again, this character is reflected in the words of Lao Tzu. The desire to want more than you have or more than you need, like titles or position or fame, may get you those things, but they will not bring lasting satisfaction.
The stronger your need for them to define who you are, the deeper the dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>You won’t win every race. You don’t always need to be doing something. You can’t really fix the world and make it better.
The world, the Universe and everything you know and experience fit together so harmoniously, how could you have an idea and believe it is an improvement on something so ageless and wise?
Josey Wales lives day to day, minute to minute even. He is making it all up as he goes as he runs from his pursuers.
In this scene, Josey and the boy, Jamie, have just gunned down a couple of hillbilly’s who had attempted to capture them in return for a pocket full of gold. The boy wants to bury them, Josey thinks otherwise.
Rightfully, he is feeling a little nasty, but he knows that life on the lam has no place for ceremonies or the normal rituals of life. It is a time for being on the move and simply allowing events to take their course without stopping to think about it or interfere.
Josey Wales is a landmark film in Eastwood’s celebrated career. The tale of a peaceful farmer turned into a desperate outlaw when is family is caught in the crossfire of some Civil War zealots. Josey refuses surrender to those same zealots and go back to a “normal” life when the war is over because, as he puts it, he’s got “nothing better to do.”
I’m sure Lao Tzu would not judge Josey for defiantly spitting on the dead hillbilly’s head right before he delivers this line. As gratuitous as it is, however, from the audience’s perspective, you wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>

<p>Finally finding a bit a respite from their perilous journey, Josey’s misfit family
stops to rest in the broken down saloon of a once prosperous mining town. Knowing better than to let his guard down, Josey alone remains vigilant.
When a bounty hunter strides in to challenge Josey, he tries to warn him not to pick this fight. But an overwhelming sense of pride compels the bounty hunter to walk</p>
<p>back into the saloon and face down certain death. Whether it’s his greed for the reward or his inability to live with the shame of backing down, he simply cannot let it go.
And so it is, we spend our days honing our skills, with our eyes on the prize, wanting and hoping and striving for a better life. Caring more about fitting in and what other people think, not realizing we are trading in the happiness of today for some unknown future.
The desire to attain or maintain some level of status is powerful. It also seems important.
It is, however, an unwinnable game. It is a distraction from everything real and a great source of unnecessary stress in the world.
It ain’t much of a way to live.</p>

The Great Way is easy,
yet people prefer side paths.
Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao.
When rich speculators prosper
while farmers lose their land;
When government officials spend money
on weapons instead of cures;
When the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn-
all this is robbery and chaos.
It is not in keeping with the Tao.</h2>
<p>Here, Lao Tzu is saying: If you are in harmony with the Tao, things stay in
balance. When too few have too much, there is none.
It is easy to see how this happens. When those representing the interests of the
people are too far away from them, the decisions they make are not always the ones the people want.
At the end of their journey, Josey’s surrogate family finally reaches the ranch house property they were seeking. They are home now, and decide to hole up and fight. Josey realizes a fight may not be necessary, however, if he can appeal directly to the Comanche chief and convince him they can peacefully co-exist.
Josey doesn’t send an envoy to represent the interests of his friends; he rides right up to Ten Bears and makes a deal himself. There is no mistaking is offer and he cannot hide from the outcome. It is genuine.
Whether it’s a “fair word or a fair fight”, Josey takes the straight path. As he puts it in his compelling speech to Ten Bears, “Dyin’ ain’t hard for men like you and me, it’s livin’ that’s hard.”
Successfully reaching an accord with Ten Bears, Lao Tzu would agree he is in keeping with the Taoist spirit of laissez-faire, live and let live, philosophy.</p>

verse:

There is no greater illusion than fear,
no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself. No greater misfortune than having an enemy.
Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.</h2>
<p>With so many beautiful, meaningful ways to spend your limited time here on
Earth, it’s tragic to spend that time living in fear.
Fear takes many forms and once you are paralyzed by this seemingly powerful
state of mind, you give up. When you give up, you lose everything.
When you choose, instead, to accept the situation and plow through it, you may
not always be “safe”, but you will no longer be defenseless.</p>
<p>This short speech, as Josey readies his team for an impending raid by the renegade Union Red Leg soldiers, is one of the all-time best from any Eastwood movie. “That’s just the way it is” is the very line where the philosophical light switch came on, so to speak, and the parallels’ between Taoism and Clint Eastwood became all too clear and recognizable.
Having lived through so many horrific situations and faced death at every turn, Josey Wales has accepted the way it is. He has no illusions of the way things are in the real world. And better still is the notion that as bloody and wicked as the world can be, Josey has not lost his humanity or his faith.
Easily one of Eastwood’s finest moments as an artist.</p>

<p>In a conversation with a fellow inmate, Frank Morris is asked, “Geez, what kind
of childhood did you have?”
Morris offers no explanation of his past, but it’s clear he realized the necessity of
living in the moment, being aware of his surroundings, at an early age. Not one to dwell on pointless “what could have been’s”, he was forced to dwell in reality. He could not run from it or pretend not to notice.</p>
<p>There are as many ways to express the belief in the Way things are as there are human beings to express them. As you ask and pray and meditate, sooner or later your eyes open to the awesomeness of it all. That is, hopefully they do.
Most people never see and scoff at such notions. Some sort of see but are too busy to bother. The few see right away and start down the path.
Escape from Alcatraz is Eastwood’s retelling of the greatest prison break story of all time. It is stark and lean and honest, much like the Leone western films. Simple and direct in both character and action, it is another work of art that reflects the Tao Te Ching itself.</p>

In family life, be completely present.
When you are content to be simply yourself and don’t compare or compete,
Everybody will respect you.</h2>
<p>Bronco Billy, if he were a real person, gives the impression he would be very
much like Mr. Eastwood himself. It has actually been written by Eastwood’s own biographer to be the case. He is tough, but humble, and content with doing his own thing; following his own rules.
The movie is the story of a down and out, New Jersey shoe salesman who decides to throw caution to the wind and start a circus like Wild West show. Not necessarily the smartest man, Billy is simple and true in the best sense. He follows his dream at all costs and is compassionate towards his friends and even his enemies. He pulls together another Eastwood make shift family of misfits.
It is not difficult to understand Lao Tzu’s words in this verse, which is aptly suited to this quote. It is distinctly clear that Bronco Billy represents everything the Old Master is teaching here.
“To simply be yourself” sounds basic enough, yes? Yet few can put it into practice. Who has the courage to follow their own path, regardless of what others are doing?
As the brilliant, late mythology Professor, Joseph Campbell would say, “Follow your bliss!”
There is no better thing in the world.</p>

What is a good man but a bad man’s teacher? What is a bad man but a good man’s job?
If you don’t understand this, you will get lost, However intelligent you are.
It is the great secret.</h2>
<p>Arguably, the most famous of all Clint Eastwood one liners.
Dirty Harry doesn’t shy away from violence, but his driving motivation is to
restore balance to a system he views as corrupt and chaotic. The bureaucrats and politicians are every bit a part of the problem as the drug dealers. Inspector Callahan, however, is as incorruptible on the streets as he is in City Hall.
Doubtful he would describe himself as “good”. He is only doing what he sees needs to be done, so people can go about their lives without fear. He doesn’t judge the “bad” guys for being bad; so much as he fervently wants them to stop acting crazy and hurting people. Unfortunately for them, he will do so by any means.</p>
<p>In Sudden Impact, Callahan is on the case to find an apparent serial killer. Unknowingly, he falls for the killer; a woman on a quest for vengeance as she tracks down the men who once attacked her. He is sympathetic to her motives, as they are similar to his own. But he is un-approving of her above-the-law methods.
“What is a bad man but a good man’s job?” furthers the idea that Inspector Callahan exists only because the criminal also exists. It is his job to be the opposing example.
What else is there in this life but to be an example for all those that don’t see the Way? Not by preaching at them with empty rhetoric, but rather by walking the walk.</p>

The world is formed from the void,
like utensils from a block of wood.
The Master knows the utensils, yet keeps to the block: thus she can use all things.</h2>
<p>Central to all teachings in the Taoist philosophy is the concept of P’u, pronounced
‘p-ooh’, like the Bear. It is literally translated as the “uncarved block.” Cut up and shaped, the block of wood can be any utensil or tool you wish. Uncarved, however, it maintains its potential to be anything.
The first line of this verse actually reads, “Know the male, yet keep to the female.” It means there is a space where ideas are born and there is a place in which to create them. We use this space of unlimited ideas all the time without realizing it because Western cultures don’t have a name for it. (By Western culture, I mean traditionally European influenced culture, not the Old West cowboy culture. Ironic?)</p>
<p>The Preacher from Pale Rider is yet another ghostly figure with No Name. He shows up mysteriously as, you might say, an uncarved block. He can be anything he is required to be. In this case, the Preacher is the catalyst for change, much like the Stranger from High Plains Drifter.
In Pale Rider, we find an unsuccessful and helpless group of gold prospectors living on the hillsides outside a small frontier village. Being terrorized and intimidated to give up their claims by a well-funded, corporate mining operation, they are in desperate need of help.
The Preacher is everything they are not; decisive and fearless. Formless, he becomes their ideal; a pattern to help them find the courage to stand up for themselves. In this scene, when the local thugs are harassing one of the prospectors in town,
the Preacher transforms a big, plain old stick into a tool for stopping a few bullies.</p>

Gunny Highway Heartbreak Ridge
verse:

text: |
Knowing others is intelligence; Knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; Mastering yourself is true power.</h2>
<p>Gunny Highway clearly isn’t the most refined character. The rag-tag platoon of
Marine Recon recruits he is assigned to train are even less so. Having experienced mortal combat, however, he has mastered himself and his fear.
As a master soldier, he has but one lesson to teach: be like me and you will survive. Let go of what you think you know and be aware of your surroundings. Adapt to what comes next. Pay attention, learn to control yourself and you will live.
All the other things you may have learned are of little use if you cannot master yourself in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Heartbreak Ridge is not a serious war movie. It is mostly light-hearted and comical. Eastwood creates a caricature, rather than a commentary, on the machismo of the martial state of mind.
As gruff and over-the-top sure of himself as he is, Gunny Highway also reluctantly reveals a softer side, when attempting to reconcile with his estranged wife or help out a recruit struggling to raise his family. This is the endearing Eastwood that makes movies like this work, rather than fail.
This is also how I often think of Lao Tzu. He might say, “These lessons are ancient and wise and very serious, and you should take them seriously. But let’s not forget our sense of humor and compassion along the Way.”</p>

means thinking that he is evil.
Thus you destroy your three treasures and become an enemy yourself.
When two great forces oppose each other

<p>Inspector Callahan is not afraid to force the issue, but his best tactic is direct,
steely eyed intimidation; his specialty, really. If he can get someone to back down without breaking the peace, he will usually give that the first shot.</p>
<p>Aware, however, that his adversaries share these same tactics (usually with less success), Callahan understands they are merely on opposite sides of the law. They are every bit as determined and lethal as he is.
When finally it’s clear his foes are not influenced by his intimidating warnings and refuse to break, Dirty Harry yields to another form of influence; his .44 Magnum.
As much as he is likely satisfied to stop his opponents by any means necessary, you never see him celebrate the victory. In fact, it is just the opposite. He doesn’t want the victory, so much as he keep them from achieving it.
This is one way to interpret the Tao Te Ching here. Winning is the goal. Taking pleasure in it is not a complete win.
The Dead Pool is the last of the Dirty Harry Callahan movies. Eastwood finally yielded this character to cinema history and won a small victory in return.</p>

<p>“Failure is an opportunity.” An opportunity to look inside yourself for the reason
you lost. It is a chance for self-examination.</p>
<p>You will never be moved to improve by making excuses and finding cause to your shortfalls on the outside. The better person always uses a failure as a way to find the Way.
In White Hunter, Black Heart, the eccentric artist and film maker, Mr. Wilson, is mired in debt and half fulfilled obligations. Yet he never hesitates. He is aware that the pressure to finish his movie is all on him and seems to rather like it that way.
When he finally completes what he has set out to do, it is either an epic loss or a magnificent triumph. Wilson finds wisdom in both.
Like Bronco Billy, there is a lot of Clint Eastwood to be found in the John Wilson character (though he was in reality based on the famous director/actor John Huston). Eastwood doesn’t play it straight like Bronco Billy, but Wilson has that same cool, plain- talking attitude as Eastwood.

The Universe provides no guarantees. If you think and scheme too much to

This is called “non-Tao”. Obviously, it is in dis-harmony with the Way things are, like swimming upstream. You will soon get tired and lose the battle.</p>
<p>In The Rookie, veteran cop Nick Pulovski, played by Eastwood, takes on an idealistic rookie partner who comes from a wealthy family. When his over protective father attempts to pay off Pulovski to keep his kid out of harm’s way, Pulovski will have none of it.
Pulovski knows the job is inherently dangerous and that is what you sign up for when you get into it. Any extra effort on his part to lessen the risks will likely have the opposite effect.
Though The Rookie was not a great critical or box office success, Eastwood finds some wisdom in the result. He was quoted as saying, “Sometimes these things work; sometimes they don’t.”</p>

Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao? Because, being one with the Tao,
When you seek, you find;
And when you make a mistake, you are forgiven. That is why everybody loves it.</h2>
<p>After William Munny and one of his partners in crime, the self-proclaimed
Scofield Kid, execute a dumb cowboy for cutting up a woman, the Kid gets scared. He starts to make excuses for why he was able to point blank kill an unarmed man. “I guess they had it coming,” he says.</p>
<p>As the reformed killer anti-hero of Unforgiven, Munny had likely never heard the word karma. Still, he seemed to grasp the idea, as almost everyone does. You get what you give.
Munny’s true nature is brutal and violent. Even though he senses that setting his nature free means he may one day pay the price, Munny is in more pain trying to hold it back than letting it run its course. It is his acceptance of this fate, and the lack of fear of it, where I see a connection to the Tao.
Eastwood’s protagonist in Unforgiven is what all the main characters in his previous Westerns are not. Or maybe he is them, just older now. The Man With No Name unapologetically rid the world of villains for some righteous purpose and didn’t think twice about it. Munny, by contrast, is full of regret. As an aging, struggling pig farmer, he is reluctant to find adventure and the trouble that comes with it. Yet deep down, he knows one day he must face the fact that he just is trouble.
The Universe created a natural born killer. He wishes it was different and is apologetic for the things he’s done. He has sought refuge, by once having settled down and married. He has sought forgiveness, by proclaiming to his best friend, Ned, “I ain’t like that no more.”
But when he learns his best friend has been killed and utters this unforgettable line, you can see in his eyes he has returned to and accepted his natural ways.</p>

<p>About to get shot point blank by Munny, the wounded, defenseless Sheriff Little
Bill Daggett protests, “I don’t deserve to die like this.”
William Munny and Little Bill are cut from the same cloth. Barely
distinguishable in character, except one cloaks his meanness under title and position while the other lets his nature loose. Truly ambiguous to what is right or wrong, good or</p>
<p>bad, the situation doesn’t hold up to justification. This is just want it comes down to in the end.
The actual text from the Tao Te Ching reads, “Heaven and Earth are not humane, and regard people as straw dogs.” This means the Universe was not created for our small human needs and once someone has served their purpose, so to speak, they can be let go.
Whether one is born with gifted physical talents or some debilitating disease, deserves got nothing to do with it. In the infinite and eternal expanse of the Universe, all things come about from the same source. Lao Tzu’s Master knows this.
Little Bill has served his purpose, apparently. Munny is simply the agent there to tell him the truth. No need for a long discussion.
Like Josey Wales famous last stand, “that’s just the way it is”, speech, this timeless line resonates with connection to the Taoist philosophy. From the minute I first heard it, sitting in a dark theater, I realized there was so much more to it.</p>

<p>At the very end of the film, Texas Ranger Chief Garnett is thrown into a situation
so foreign, so outside what he understood of how things “should work,” he struggles to believe it.
The Universe is so old and so large; it is beyond what even the wisest among us can imagine. We can calculate it, discuss it, study it, but we can never really know why</p>
<p>it’s here or how it works. After thousands of years of trying, there are still as many questions as ever.
You can’t know it, but you can be in awe of it. You can sit still and experience the incredible harmony of it all. Then you begin to realize there is nothing to know. Or maybe what we do know is such an infinitesimal slice of the whole, we have to admit we really know nothing.
A Perfect World is one of the first films where Eastwood plays against the outwardly imposed image of shoot ‘em cop. Garnett is a patient, even compassionate man. He is trying hard to throttle his hard-liner, trigger happy colleagues who presume they understand the situation. Without even wanting to know the whole truth, they have decided Butch Haynes, a small time hoodlum with a troubled past, must be killed.
Butch (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner) has kidnapped a young boy, who he befriends despite their desperate situation. Garnett, is empathetic to the plight of this societal misfit. Understanding that the failures of the system we live in are as much to blame as Haynes reckless choices.
If we could all just step back and take a long look at what is going on, with less arrogant belief we already know, maybe we can find a better Way.</p>

there is nothing you can’t achieve.
Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter’s place.
When you handle the master carpenter’s tools, chances are that you’ll cut your hand.</h2>
<p>Robert Kincaid is not an Eastwood creation, but Eastwood’s effortless nature and
“comfortable in his own skin” attitude made him a harmonious fit for this film; both as actor and director.
Kincaid is the character lurking underneath all the hardened cowboys. He is the non-being to their being; the formlessness behind their form. He is far from violent and</p>
<p>talks a lot more. I think William Munny and Harry Callahan would appreciate, even prefer, trading in their loaded guns for a camera.
Kincaid follows his own instincts and is able to ebb and flow with the changes that brings. He does not interfere with his own fate, even when Francesca, the unfulfilled Midwestern housewife he falls madly in love with, chooses to stay with her husband rather than run away with him.
By not interfering, he has avoided cutting his hands, so to speak.
In this verse, the Old Master is explaining why you should not fear the inevitable. Change is clearly an inevitable experience in this life, including the ultimate change of dying.
If you try too hard to avoid any of these naturally flowing and necessary changes, you risk taking your fate into your own hands, which can be a task beyond your ability.</p>

In the pursuit of knowledge,
every day something is added.
In practice of the Tao,
every day something is dropped.
Less and less do you need to force things, until finally you arrive at non-action. When nothing is done,
nothing is left undone.</h2>
<p>Aging thief and art aficionado, Luther Whitney is unwittingly caught up in a
murder cover up involving the President of the United States.
The Secret Service knows he is a witness. The local cops believe he is a suspect.
As one detective interviews Whitney and zero’s in on the truth, he implores Luther to continue to talk and meet him again. Whitney, as an older man who has seen many things and carries much regret for missing out on the important years of his estranged</p>
<p>daughter’s life, knows better. He understands that you never know what will happen next and prefers to take life one day at a time.
Tomorrow is yet to exist. But in our minds, we’ve got it all figured out; the schedule, the career path, the to-do list. The rigid adherence to these things causing great pain when all doesn’t go as planned.
“Nothing is left undone” only means to loosen your grip. Don’t try and force everything so much. Let change also be a part of the plan and let your actions flow unfiltered. So much in the world is out of your control or beyond what you can “learn”. Let go of your preconceptions and allow the billions of years of Universal wisdom to be your guide. The deepest of Lao Tzu’s many great lessons.
Learn to agree with that and happier you will be.</p>

Frankly, I don’t give a rat’s ass about Jesus Christ and I don’t care about justice in this

verse:

If you close your mind in judgments and traffic in desires,
your heart will be troubled.
If you keep your mind from judging and aren’t led by the senses,
your heart will find peace.</p>
<h2>52-</h2>
<p>There are things you should do and things you shouldn’t do, as you go along, that
create a peaceful life. Calling this one good and that one bad is unnecessary.
Babies never do this. They just want what they want and they either get it or they
don’t. Not knowing concepts such as right or wrong, good and bad, they are perfectly free. They see what they see and hear what they hear. And even though they can do these things, as anyone can, their minds do not allow them, yet, to assign any qualification. In this way, they are like the Tao.</p>
<p>At what point do we learn to pass judgment?
True Crime is an Eastwood film about man on death row after being falsely convicted of a murder. Eastwood’s character, Steve Everett, is a morally ambiguous newspaper reporter with a knack for trouble and an incredibly intuitive sense of truth.
Assigned by his hateful boss to interview Frank Beachum, the death row inmate, as a fluffy human interest story, Everett discovers the condemned man is innocent and races to prove it before Beachum is executed.
In this scene, Everett sits across from Beachum and asks if there is anything he wants to say. Beachum, trying to remain calm and conventional, provides a pat answer about finding peace and giving his soul to Jesus. But Everett, as dysfunctional and imperfect as he is, won’t accept this answer. Being in no place to judge this man, he simply wants the truth.</p>

Girlie, tough ain’t enough.
verse:

Nothing in the world
is as soft and yielding as water.
Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it.
The soft overcomes the hard; the gentle overcomes the rigid. Everyone knows this is true, but few can put it into practice.
78-</h2>
<p>Prophetically, Eastwood’s Frankie Dunn barks this one at Maggie Fitzgerald early
in the movie, as she desperately tries to convince Frankie she can fight. He knows, however, that physical toughness only gets you so far. It’s your inner strength that separates you from the rest.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this film, every character is tough and stubborn. A world of struggling, small time boxers, with few skills and less smarts. A world of old been-there- done-that trainers, like Dunn, who are carrying the weight of way too many past defeats. No force, it would appear, would cause any of them to ever change.
Yet Lao Tzu says that it is not a blunt force that dissolves the rigid front but the ever present, constant flow of patience and love. Few, he says, can put it into practice, because it at first appears as a weakness. Those of strong ego cannot endure it.
In the end, after Maggie is fatally injured during a match, her inner strength is revealed. Not in the ring, but in her resolve; her unapologetic acceptance of what needs to be done and the ability to let go. Fated forever to a hospital bed breathing through a respirator, with a hateful, uncaring family, Maggie asks her only friend to end the misery.
This act dissolves Frankie’s bitter, hardened shell and reveals the true compassion he has tried to avoid, or had never found, most of his life.
One of the Tao Te Ching’s greatest lessons.</p>

Walt Kowalski Gran Torino
verse:

text: |
Weapons are the tools of fear;
a decent man will avoid them
except in the direst of necessity
and, if compelled, will use them
only with the utmost restraint.
Peace is his highest value.
If the peace has been shattered,
how can he be content:
his enemies are not demons,
but human beings like himself.
He doesn’t wish them personal harm. Nor does he rejoice in victory.
How could he rejoice in victory
and delight in the slaughter of men?
31-</h2>
<p>Lao Tzu is less poetic in this verse. The direct language abhorring weapons and violence is not difficult to interpret. This particular stanza juxtaposed with this particular Eastwood dialogue reveals a common state of mind.
Walt Kowalski, played by Eastwood, is a cranky, retired old man who finds himself alone after his wife dies. He is resigned to living in peace with his dog, in a working class Detroit neighborhood. Unexpectedly, and unwantedly, a new family moves in next door.
In true Eastwoodian fashion, the relationship is subtle and outwardly reluctant. Understood only in Walt’s actions towards the new friends he begrudgingly, but lovingly, begins to accept.
When his new Korean neighbors find unintended trouble with a local gang, what little peace Walt Kowalski has in his small world is shattered.
Walt carries demons from his past for unsaid things he had done in a war fought long ago. In a subconscious attempt at redemption, he chooses to teach his youngest neighbor how to avoid the mistakes he’s already made. To try and maintain a peace of mind he never could. In the final scene, knowing he is already dying of lung cancer, he makes the ultimate sacrifice to save himself and his new family. Doing so, he redeems his decency and avoids the use of the tools of fear.
And let’s not ever forget that the young neighbor’s name just happens to be Tao.</p>
