      <p>Weapons are the tools of fear; <br>
a decent man will avoid them <br>
except in the direst of necessity <br>
and, if compelled, will use them <br>
only with the utmost restraint. <br>
Peace is his highest value. <br>
If the peace has been shattered, <br>
how can he be content: <br>
his enemies are not demons, <br>
but human beings like himself. <br>
He doesn’t wish them personal harm. <br>
Nor does he rejoice in victory. <br>
How could he rejoice in victory <br>
and delight in the slaughter of men?</p>

  <p>Lao Tzu is less poetic in this verse.
The direct language abhorring weapons and violence is not
difficult to interpret.
This particular stanza juxtaposed with this particular
Eastwood dialogue reveals a common state of mind.</p>
<p>Walt Kowalski, played by Eastwood, is a cranky,
retired old man who finds himself alone after his wife dies.
He is resigned to living in peace with his dog,
in a working class Detroit neighborhood.
Unexpectedly, and unwantedly, a new family moves in next door.</p>
<p>In true Eastwoodian fashion,
the relationship is subtle and outwardly reluctant.
Understood only in Walt’s actions towards the new friends he begrudgingly,
but lovingly, begins to accept.</p>
<p>When his new Korean neighbors find unintended trouble with a local gang,
what little peace Walt Kowalski has in his small world is shattered.</p>
<p>Walt carries demons from his past for unsaid things he had
done in a war fought long ago. In a subconscious attempt at redemption,
he chooses to teach his youngest neighbor how to avoid the
mistakes he’s already made.
To try and maintain a peace of mind he never could.
In the final scene, knowing he is already dying of lung cancer,
he makes the ultimate sacrifice to save himself and his new family.
Doing so, he redeems his decency and avoids the use of the tools of fear.</p>
<p>And let’s not ever forget that the
young neighbor’s name just happens to be Tao.</p>
