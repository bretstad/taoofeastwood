Thankfully, as of this writing, Mr. Eastwood has not decided to retire. There will be more movies to enjoy and more wisdom to impart from each one. The passages included here are but a sliver of the enormous body of work this distinguished artist has created or will create in the future.

With so much to work with, this book could have been packed with dense analysis and a whole lot more words. But that would miss the mark. It is true that sometimes less is more and I have faith that the reader will take away exactly what they need to from what is included here.

Across the span of time and all these great films, the steadiness and constancy persists. The “unsaid-ness” of action, the openness and the reoccurring nature of balance and authenticity is what Clint Eastwood is all about. This is the essence of the connection between all these characters, this artist and the very Wise Old Sage.
