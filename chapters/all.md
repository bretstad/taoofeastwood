    Governments don’t live together, people live together. With governments, you don’t
always get a fair word or a fair fight. Well, I’ve come here to give you either one, or get
either one from you.
Josey Wales
The Outlaw Josey Wales
verse:
  number: '53'
  text: |
The Great Way is easy,
yet people prefer side paths.
Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao.
When rich speculators prosper
while farmers lose their land;
When government officials spend money
on weapons instead of cures;
When the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn-
all this is robbery and chaos.
It is not in keeping with the Tao.
---

Here, Lao Tzu is saying: If you are in harmony with the Tao, things stay in balance. When too few have too much, there is none.

It is easy to see how this happens. When those representing the interests of the people are too far away from them, the decisions they make are not always the ones the people want.

At the end of their journey, Josey’s surrogate family finally reaches the ranch house property they were seeking. They are home now, and decide to hole up and fight. Josey realizes a fight may not be necessary, however, if he can appeal directly to the Comanche chief and convince him they can peacefully co-exist.

Josey doesn’t send an envoy to represent the interests of his friends; he rides right up to Ten Bears and makes a deal himself. There is no mistaking is offer and he cannot hide from the outcome. It is genuine.

Whether it’s a “fair word or a fair fight”, Josey takes the straight path. As he puts it in his compelling speech to Ten Bears, “Dyin’ ain’t hard for men like you and me, it’s livin’ that’s hard.”

Successfully reaching an accord with Ten Bears, Lao Tzu would agree he is in keeping with the Taoist spirit of laissez-faire, live and let live, philosophy.

    Now remember, when things look bad and it looks like you’re not gonna make it, then
you gotta get mean. I mean plum mad dog mean. Cause if you lose your head and you
give up, you neither live nor win. That’s just the way it is.
Josey Wales
The Outlaw Josey Wales
verse:
  number: '46'
  text: |
There is no greater illusion than fear,
no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself. No greater misfortune than having an enemy.
Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.
---

With so many beautiful, meaningful ways to spend your limited time here on Earth, it’s tragic to spend that time living in fear.

Fear takes many forms and once you are paralyzed by this seemingly powerful state of mind, you give up. When you give up, you lose everything.

When you choose, instead, to accept the situation and plow through it, you may not always be “safe”, but you will no longer be defenseless.

This short speech, as Josey readies his team for an impending raid by the renegade Union Red Leg soldiers, is one of the all-time best from any Eastwood movie. “That’s just the way it is” is the very line where the philosophical light switch came on, so to speak, and the parallels’ between Taoism and Clint Eastwood became all too clear and recognizable.

Having lived through so many horrific situations and faced death at every turn, Josey Wales has accepted the way it is. He has no illusions of the way things are in the real world. And better still is the notion that as bloody and wicked as the world can be, Josey has not lost his humanity or his faith.

Easily one of Eastwood’s finest moments as an artist.

When a superior man hears of the Tao, he immediately begins to embrace it. When an average man hears of the Tao, he half believes it, half doubts it.
When a foolish man hears of the Tao, he laughs out loud.
If he didn’t laugh,
it wouldn’t be the Tao.
---

In a conversation with a fellow inmate, Frank Morris is asked, “Geez, what kind of childhood did you have?”

Morris offers no explanation of his past, but it’s clear he realized the necessity of living in the moment, being aware of his surroundings, at an early age. Not one to dwell on pointless “what could have been’s”, he was forced to dwell in reality. He could not run from it or pretend not to notice.

There are as many ways to express the belief in the Way things are as there are human beings to express them. As you ask and pray and meditate, sooner or later your eyes open to the awesomeness of it all. That is, hopefully they do.

Most people never see and scoff at such notions. Some sort of see but are too busy to bother. The few see right away and start down the path.

Escape from Alcatraz is Eastwood’s retelling of the greatest prison break story of all time. It is stark and lean and honest, much like the Leone western films. Simple and direct in both character and action, it is another work of art that reflects the Tao Te Ching itself.

The supreme good is like water,
which nourishes all things without trying.
It is content with the low places that people disdain. Thus it is like the Tao.
In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple.
In conflict, be fair and generous.
In governing, don’t try to control.
In work, do what you enjoy.
In family life, be completely present.
When you are content to be simply yourself and don’t compare or compete,
Everybody will respect you.
---

Bronco Billy, if he were a real person, gives the impression he would be very
much like Mr. Eastwood himself. It has actually been written by Eastwood’s own biographer to be the case. He is tough, but humble, and content with doing his own thing; following his own rules.

The movie is the story of a down and out, New Jersey shoe salesman who decides to throw caution to the wind and start a circus like Wild West show. Not necessarily the smartest man, Billy is simple and true in the best sense. He follows his dream at all costs and is compassionate towards his friends and even his enemies. He pulls together another Eastwood make shift family of misfits.

It is not difficult to understand Lao Tzu’s words in this verse, which is aptly suited to this quote. It is distinctly clear that Bronco Billy represents everything the Old Master is teaching here.

“To simply be yourself” sounds basic enough, yes? Yet few can put it into practice. Who has the courage to follow their own path, regardless of what others are doing?

As the brilliant, late mythology Professor, Joseph Campbell would say, “Follow your bliss!”

There is no better thing in the world.

What is a good man but a bad man’s teacher? What is a bad man but a good man’s job?
If you don’t understand this, you will get lost, However intelligent you are.
It is the great secret.
---

Arguably, the most famous of all Clint Eastwood one liners.
Dirty Harry doesn’t shy away from violence, but his driving motivation is to restore balance to a system he views as corrupt and chaotic. The bureaucrats and politicians are every bit a part of the problem as the drug dealers. Inspector Callahan, however, is as incorruptible on the streets as he is in City Hall.

Doubtful he would describe himself as “good”. He is only doing what he sees needs to be done, so people can go about their lives without fear. He doesn’t judge the “bad” guys for being bad; so much as he fervently wants them to stop acting crazy and hurting people. Unfortunately for them, he will do so by any means.

In Sudden Impact, Callahan is on the case to find an apparent serial killer. Unknowingly, he falls for the killer; a woman on a quest for vengeance as she tracks down the men who once attacked her. He is sympathetic to her motives, as they are similar to his own. But he is un-approving of her above-the-law methods.

“What is a bad man but a good man’s job?” furthers the idea that Inspector Callahan exists only because the criminal also exists. It is his job to be the opposing example.

What else is there in this life but to be an example for all those that don’t see the Way? Not by preaching at them with empty rhetoric, but rather by walking the walk.

    Nothing like a good piece of hickory.
verse:
  number: '28'
  text: |
The world is formed from the void,
like utensils from a block of wood.
The Master knows the utensils, yet keeps to the block: thus she can use all things.
---

Central to all teachings in the Taoist philosophy is the concept of P’u, pronounced ‘p-ooh’, like the Bear. It is literally translated as the “uncarved block.” Cut up and shaped, the block of wood can be any utensil or tool you wish. Uncarved, however, it maintains its potential to be anything.

The first line of this verse actually reads, “Know the male, yet keep to the female.” It means there is a space where ideas are born and there is a place in which to create them. We use this space of unlimited ideas all the time without realizing it because Western cultures don’t have a name for it. (By Western culture, I mean traditionally European influenced culture, not the Old West cowboy culture. Ironic?)

The Preacher from Pale Rider is yet another ghostly figure with No Name. He shows up mysteriously as, you might say, an uncarved block. He can be anything he is required to be. In this case, the Preacher is the catalyst for change, much like the Stranger from High Plains Drifter.

In Pale Rider, we find an unsuccessful and helpless group of gold prospectors living on the hillsides outside a small frontier village. Being terrorized and intimidated to give up their claims by a well-funded, corporate mining operation, they are in desperate need of help.

The Preacher is everything they are not; decisive and fearless. Formless, he becomes their ideal; a pattern to help them find the courage to stand up for themselves. In this scene, when the local thugs are harassing one of the prospectors in town, the Preacher transforms a big, plain old stick into a tool for stopping a few bullies.

    My name’s Gunnery Sergeant Highway and I’ve drunk more beer and banged more quiff
and pissed more blood and stomped more ass than all you numbnuts put together.
verse:
  number: '33'
  text: |
Knowing others is intelligence; Knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; Mastering yourself is true power.
---

Gunny Highway clearly isn’t the most refined character. The rag-tag platoon of Marine Recon recruits he is assigned to train are even less so. Having experienced mortal combat, however, he has mastered himself and his fear.

As a master soldier, he has but one lesson to teach: be like me and you will survive. Let go of what you think you know and be aware of your surroundings. Adapt to what comes next. Pay attention, learn to control yourself and you will live.

All the other things you may have learned are of little use if you cannot master yourself in the heat of battle.

Heartbreak Ridge is not a serious war movie. It is mostly light-hearted and comical. Eastwood creates a caricature, rather than a commentary, on the machismo of the martial state of mind.

As gruff and over-the-top sure of himself as he is, Gunny Highway also reluctantly reveals a softer side, when attempting to reconcile with his estranged wife or help out a recruit struggling to raise his family. This is the endearing Eastwood that makes movies like this work, rather than fail.

This is also how I often think of Lao Tzu. He might say, “These lessons are ancient and wise and very serious, and you should take them seriously. But let’s not forget our sense of humor and compassion along the Way.”

There is no greater misfortune
than underestimating your enemy. Underestimating your enemy
means thinking that he is evil.
Thus you destroy your three treasures and become an enemy yourself.
When two great forces oppose each other
the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield.
---

Inspector Callahan is not afraid to force the issue, but his best tactic is direct, steely eyed intimidation; his specialty, really. If he can get someone to back down without breaking the peace, he will usually give that the first shot.

Aware, however, that his adversaries share these same tactics (usually with less success), Callahan understands they are merely on opposite sides of the law. They are every bit as determined and lethal as he is.

When finally it’s clear his foes are not influenced by his intimidating warnings and refuse to break, Dirty Harry yields to another form of influence; his .44 Magnum.

As much as he is likely satisfied to stop his opponents by any means necessary, you never see him celebrate the victory. In fact, it is just the opposite. He doesn’t want the victory, so much as he keep them from achieving it.

This is one way to interpret the Tao Te Ching here. Winning is the goal. Taking pleasure in it is not a complete win.

The Dead Pool is the last of the Dirty Harry Callahan movies. Eastwood finally yielded this character to cinema history and won a small victory in return.

verse:

Failure is an opportunity.
If you blame someone else, There is no end to the blame.
Therefore the Master
Fulfills her own obligations And corrects her own mistakes. She does what she needs to do And demands nothing of others.
---

“Failure is an opportunity.” An opportunity to look inside yourself for the reason you lost. It is a chance for self-examination.

You will never be moved to improve by making excuses and finding cause to your shortfalls on the outside. The better person always uses a failure as a way to find the Way.

In White Hunter, Black Heart, the eccentric artist and film maker, Mr. Wilson, is mired in debt and half fulfilled obligations. Yet he never hesitates. He is aware that the pressure to finish his movie is all on him and seems to rather like it that way.

When he finally completes what he has set out to do, it is either an epic loss or a magnificent triumph. Wilson finds wisdom in both.

Like Bronco Billy, there is a lot of Clint Eastwood to be found in the John Wilson character (though he was in reality based on the famous director/actor John Huston). Eastwood doesn’t play it straight like Bronco Billy, but Wilson has that same cool, plain- talking attitude as Eastwood. The competent, compassionate detachment that is relatable to Lao Tzu’s often referenced “Master”.

  The Masters power is like this. He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire. He never expects results;
thus he is never disappointed. He is never disappointed;
thus his spirit never grows old.
---

Try as you might, you’ll never predict the future. Trying to control the outcome of certain events only leads to frustration and stress.

The Universe provides no guarantees. If you think and scheme too much to achieve whatever it is you are chasing down, you will fall apart faster than if you simply follow your natural way.

This is called “non-Tao”. Obviously, it is in dis-harmony with the Way things are, like swimming upstream. You will soon get tired and lose the battle.

In The Rookie, veteran cop Nick Pulovski, played by Eastwood, takes on an idealistic rookie partner who comes from a wealthy family. When his over protective father attempts to pay off Pulovski to keep his kid out of harm’s way, Pulovski will have none of it.

Pulovski knows the job is inherently dangerous and that is what you sign up for when you get into it. Any extra effort on his part to lessen the risks will likely have the opposite effect.

Though The Rookie was not a great critical or box office success, Eastwood finds some wisdom in the result. He was quoted as saying, “Sometimes these things work; sometimes they don’t.”

    We all got it comin’ kid.

The Tao is the center of the universe, The good man’s treasure,
The bad man’s refuge.
Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao? Because, being one with the Tao,
When you seek, you find;
And when you make a mistake, you are forgiven. That is why everybody loves it.
---

After William Munny and one of his partners in crime, the self-proclaimed Scofield Kid, execute a dumb cowboy for cutting up a woman, the Kid gets scared. He starts to make excuses for why he was able to point blank kill an unarmed man. “I guess they had it coming,” he says.

As the reformed killer anti-hero of Unforgiven, Munny had likely never heard the word karma. Still, he seemed to grasp the idea, as almost everyone does. You get what you give.

Munny’s true nature is brutal and violent. Even though he senses that setting his nature free means he may one day pay the price, Munny is in more pain trying to hold it back than letting it run its course. It is his acceptance of this fate, and the lack of fear of it, where I see a connection to the Tao.

Eastwood’s protagonist in Unforgiven is what all the main characters in his previous Westerns are not. Or maybe he is them, just older now. The Man With No Name unapologetically rid the world of villains for some righteous purpose and didn’t think twice about it. Munny, by contrast, is full of regret. As an aging, struggling pig farmer, he is reluctant to find adventure and the trouble that comes with it. Yet deep down, he knows one day he must face the fact that he just is trouble.

The Universe created a natural born killer. He wishes it was different and is apologetic for the things he’s done. He has sought refuge, by once having settled down and married. He has sought forgiveness, by proclaiming to his best friend, Ned, “I ain’t like that no more.”

But when he learns his best friend has been killed and utters this unforgettable line, you can see in his eyes he has returned to and accepted his natural ways.

The more you use it, the more it produces;
the more you talk of it, the less you understand.
---

About to get shot point blank by Munny, the wounded, defenseless Sheriff Little Bill Daggett protests, “I don’t deserve to die like this.”

William Munny and Little Bill are cut from the same cloth. Barely distinguishable in character, except one cloaks his meanness under title and position while the other lets his nature loose. Truly ambiguous to what is right or wrong, good or bad, the situation doesn’t hold up to justification. This is just want it comes down to in the end.

The actual text from the Tao Te Ching reads, “Heaven and Earth are not humane, and regard people as straw dogs.” This means the Universe was not created for our small human needs and once someone has served their purpose, so to speak, they can be let go.

Whether one is born with gifted physical talents or some debilitating disease, deserves got nothing to do with it. In the infinite and eternal expanse of the Universe, all things come about from the same source. Lao Tzu’s Master knows this.

Little Bill has served his purpose, apparently. Munny is simply the agent there to tell him the truth. No need for a long discussion.

Like Josey Wales famous last stand, “that’s just the way it is”, speech, this timeless line resonates with connection to the Taoist philosophy. From the minute I first heard it, sitting in a dark theater, I realized there was so much more to it.

Not knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick;
Then you can move towards health.
The Master’s her own physician. She has healed herself of knowing. Thus she is truly whole.
---

At the very end of the film, Texas Ranger Chief Garnett is thrown into a situation
so foreign, so outside what he understood of how things “should work,” he struggles to believe it.

The Universe is so old and so large; it is beyond what even the wisest among us can imagine. We can calculate it, discuss it, study it, but we can never really know why it’s here or how it works. After thousands of years of trying, there are still as many questions as ever.

You can’t know it, but you can be in awe of it. You can sit still and experience the incredible harmony of it all. Then you begin to realize there is nothing to know. Or maybe what we do know is such an infinitesimal slice of the whole, we have to admit we really know nothing.

A Perfect World is one of the first films where Eastwood plays against the outwardly imposed image of shoot ‘em cop. Garnett is a patient, even compassionate man. He is trying hard to throttle his hard-liner, trigger happy colleagues who presume they understand the situation. Without even wanting to know the whole truth, they have decided Butch Haynes, a small time hoodlum with a troubled past, must be killed.

Butch (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner) has kidnapped a young boy, who he befriends despite their desperate situation. Garnett, is empathetic to the plight of this societal misfit. Understanding that the failures of the system we live in are as much to blame as Haynes reckless choices.

If we could all just step back and take a long look at what is going on, with less arrogant belief we already know, maybe we can find a better Way.
