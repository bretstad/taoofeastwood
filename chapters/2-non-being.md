    "At that time I needed a mask rather than an actor,
    and Eastwood had only two facial expressions:
    one with the hat and one without it."

    We join spokes together in a wheel, \
    but it is the center hole \
    that makes the wagon move. \
    We shape clay into a pot, \
    but it is the emptiness inside \
    that holds whatever we want. \
    We hammer wood for a house, \
    but it is the inner space \
    that makes it livable. \
    We work with being, \
    but non-being is what we use.

You may see a camel in a passing cloud where someone else sees a boat.
The cloud is still a cloud, however. Formless, it can be all forms.

Lau Tzu is telling us that, many times,
what is not there is more useful than what is.
People have a difficult time grasping this one.
It is hard to hold in your mind’s eye the concept of useful emptiness.
Consider time, however.
Time has no form; you can’t touch it.
Until, of course, you build a clock.

Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns have a certain atmosphere
that forces the audience to become aware of what isn’t there.

The space and emptiness become another character in the movie;
a silent background character of great presence
upon which the Man With No Name can bring about some action.

Whether is the wide open desert,
the lonely, isolated village or the big empty graveyard,
the void is all too noticeable.
Even the long pauses between dialogues,
as characters study each other, serve this purpose.
The formless backdrops and spacing, like the stoic,
independent drifter, hold endless potential.

Without the hat, Eastwood is being and substantial.
With it, he is the ghost.

The popularity and joy in watching these great films
endures because of Leone’s and Eastwood’s agreement on this,
intentional or not.
