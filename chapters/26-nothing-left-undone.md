    Remember, tomorrow is promised to no one.
verse:

    In the pursuit of knowledge, \
    every day something is added. \
    In practice of the Tao, \
    every day something is dropped. \
    Less and less do you need to force things, \
    until finally you arrive at non-action. \
    When nothing is done, \
    nothing is left undone.

Aging thief and art aficionado, Luther Whitney is unwittingly caught up in a murder cover up involving the President of the United States.

The Secret Service knows he is a witness. The local cops believe he is a suspect.

As one detective interviews Whitney and zero’s in on the truth, he implores Luther to continue to talk and meet him again. Whitney, as an older man who has seen many things and carries much regret for missing out on the important years of his estranged daughter’s life, knows better. He understands that you never know what will happen next and prefers to take life one day at a time.

Tomorrow is yet to exist. But in our minds, we’ve got it all figured out; the schedule, the career path, the to-do list. The rigid adherence to these things causing great pain when all doesn’t go as planned.

“Nothing is left undone” only means to loosen your grip. Don’t try and force everything so much. Let change also be a part of the plan and let your actions flow unfiltered. So much in the world is out of your control or beyond what you can “learn”. Let go of your preconceptions and allow the billions of years of Universal wisdom to be your guide. The deepest of Lao Tzu’s many great lessons.

Learn to agree with that and happier you will be.
